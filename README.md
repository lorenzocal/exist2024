EXIST 2024

This repository contains the code of our contribution to the 2024 EXIST challenge, which aims to identify instances of sexism within tweets. Modifications have been made to the implementation of solutions proposed by some of the competition participants. In particular, two distinct classification models are proposed. The first employs a fine-tuned version of RoBERTa, while the second utilises Google's Gemini for zero-shot classification.
