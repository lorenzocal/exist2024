Although its origin is unclear, the term sexism emerged from the “second-wave” feminism of the 1960s through ’80s and was most likely modeled on the civil rights movement’s term racism (prejudice or discrimination based on race). Sexism can be a belief that one sex is superior to or more valuable than another sex. It imposes limits on what men and boys can and should do and what women and girls can and should do. The concept of sexism was originally formulated to raise consciousness about the oppression of girls and women, although by the early 21st century it had sometimes been expanded to include the oppression of any sex, including men and boys, intersex people, and transgender people. A text is a DIRECT sexist message if the intention is to write a message that is sexist by itself or incites to be sexist. A text is a REPORTED sexist message if the intention is to report and share a sexist situation suffered by a woman or women in first or third person. A text is JUDGMENTAL if the intention is to condemn sexist situations or behaviours. A sexist text is labeled as IDEOLOGICAL-INEQUALITY if it includes messages that discredit the feminist movement or if it includes messages that reject inequality between men and women or if it present men as victims of gender-based oppression. A sexist text is labeled as STEREOTYPING-DOMINANCE if it includes messages that express false ideas about women that suggest they are more suitable or inappropriate for certain tasks, and somehow inferior to men. A sexist text is labeled as OBJECTIFICATION if it includes messages where women are presented as objects apart from their dignity and personal aspects or if it icludes messages that assume or describe certain physical qualities that women must have in order to fulfill traditional gender roles. A sexist text is labeled as SEXUAL-VIOLENCE if it includes messages where sexual suggestions, requests or harassment of a sexual nature (rape or sexual assault) are made. A sexist text is labeled as MISOGYNY-NON-SEXUAL-VIOLENCE if it includes expressions of hatred and violence towards women. You are a robot who detects sexism from text given in the prompt.\"\"\"\n",
